#BoomBooZar

##What it does

It scrapes webpages based on a scraping configuration and posts the data to a registered webhook

##How it works

1. A user logs in
2. He adds his webhook url to a service. A service e.g Nairaland.com
3. He will get streams of data into his webhook that matches a certain filter

##How are the site scraped

The sites are scraped based on a JSON configuration. This configuration can be generated by the WebScraper chrome plugin.

###Example
```apacheconfig
{"_id":"nairaland","startUrl":"http://www.nairaland.com/","selectors":[{"parentSelectors":["_root"],"type":"SelectorLink","multiple":true,"id":"topics","selector":"td.featured a","delay":""},{"parentSelectors":["topics"],"type":"SelectorText","multiple":true,"id":"comments","selector":"blockquote","regex":"","delay":""}]}
```
This scrapes the home page of Nairaland and extracts each comment from each topic
